# social

It is a simple web application built in mid-2019 using React. The UI/UX is inspired by the desktop version of Instagram. The purpose of this project was to make a proof of concept of the potential of the ReactJS library.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

then start the development server:

```
npm run start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building

To create an optimised version of the app:

```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
